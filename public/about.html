        <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
        <p>
          Noise pollution is the intrusion of loud or unwarranted sounds that
          can detrimentally impact an individual's well-being. When considering
          the mental and physical health implications of noise pollution,
          understanding measurement parameters is essential; only sounds
          negatively associated with impairing health should be classified as
          noise. Assessing sound involves parameters such as loudness,
          quantified as sound pressure level measured in decibels (dB),
          operating on a logarithmic scale. The human auditory range spans from
          0 dB to 140 dB, with every 3 dB increase signifying a doubling in
          sound intensity. The chart below shows a decibel chart, explaining
          examples of each sound level.

        <p>
          Noise pollution poses substantial threats to individuals' physical and
          mental well-being. The key hazards of noise pollution include hearing
          loss, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and sleep
          disturbance. Many national governments have legislation and decibel
          limit values that may apply either nationally or regionally, informed
          by noise exposure data and noise maps. Guidelines such as the WHO
          guidelines are public-health oriented and serve as the basis for
          policy-making. Along with policies, noise mapping is a valuable tool
          for assessing and visualizing noise levels across a given region. The
          process involves adding noise data measurements to a graphical
          representation, highlighting areas with higher noise levels.

        <h2>Noise Laws in Puerto Rico</h2>
        <p>
          Puerto Rico's regulations addressing noise pollution are described in
          the Public Order Code. Article 2,201 within the Public Order Code
          specifically outlines the legal framework associated with preventing
          noise pollution, emphasizing the importance of refraining from
          emitting or distributing noise that exceeds specified decibel level
          limits, contingent on the time of day. According to the law, the
          permissible sound levels are set at 65 decibels between 7 am and 10
          pm, and lowered to 55 decibels during nighttime hours.
