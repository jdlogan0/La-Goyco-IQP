          <p>
            Noise pollution, defined as the intrusion of unwarranted sounds, is
            associated with adverse health effects such as cardiovascular
            problems, mental health impacts, hearing loss, and cognitive
            impairment (Kloth et al., 2019). High noise levels increase the risk
            of individuals experiencing hearing impairment by 30%, and 13.5% of
            deaths are connected to high blood pressure, a direct consequence of
            noise pollution (Cruickshanks et al., 2015; Europe, 2011). The issue
            of noise pollution is significant in Puerto Rico, where more than
            21% experience hearing loss in at least one ear (Cruickshanks et
            al., 2015). Among U.S. jurisdictions, Puerto Rico has the highest
            percentage of its population exposed to noise pollution (dB levels
            exceeding 70) at 44%, surpassing the average of 30% (Neitzel et al.,
            2023). This handbook aims to give a background on noise pollution in
            Puerto Rico and how to make improvements to help minimize noise.

          <h2 id="sources">Sources of Noise</h2>
          <h3 id="vehciles">Vehicles</h3>
          <p>
            Vehicles in Puerto Rico contribute to levels of noise pollution
            through the modification of the exhaust pipe and muffler. Cars are
            specifically adjusted to create more noise. Along with the
            modifications of cars, the use of car horns causes short bursts of
            high levels of noise.
          </p>
          <h3 id="voceteo">Voceteo</h3>
          <p>
            In a subsection to vehicular noise, voceteo in San Juan has created
            an unnecessarily high level of noise. In January of 2023, the Senate
            of Puerto Rico made amendments to the Vehicle and Traffic Law to
            prevent the use of vehicles on public roads or land that generate
            excessive noise or surpass the sound pressure limits set by
            legislation. There are fines set in place, the basic fine would be
            $500, with an additional fine of $250 if this occurs in a school
            zone or anytime between 10pm and 6am.
          </p>
          <h2 id="business">Business</h2>
          <p>
            In Puerto Rico, the increase in tourism activities such as the
            number of restaurants, bars, hotels, and travel caused elevated
            noise levels, amplifying the potential risks to the well-being of
            its residents (Backiel et al., 2004). Bars and clubs are suspected
            to play music at high levels to attract more customers to their
            establishments.
          </p>
          <h2 id="personal-noise">Personal Noise Reduction</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of policy changes, there are ways inside the household to
            combat noise. One option that was found is the addition of carpeting
            in a household. Carpets and the padding under them absorb sound
            waves to conceal the reverberation of noise. Curtains as well are a
            great tool to combat exterior noise. The density and thickness of
            the curtain material impede the transmission of sound from the
            outside. Furniture plays a role in dampening the effects of noise.
            Plush furniture, cushions and upholstery absorb sound and contribute
            to a quieter environment. Door draft stoppers block the entry of
            external noise from entering a room. Rubber stoppers and pads on the
            bottom of table and chair legs reduces the amount of vibrations
            transmitted through the floor of a room. Indoor plants and foliage
            can help absorb high-frequency and provide a natural and
            aesthetically pleasing way to enhance the acoustic environment. The
            effectiveness of each item may vary, and combining multiple
            strategies can provide a more comprehensive noise reduction in a
            given space.
          </p>
          <h2 id="policy">Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Puerto Rico's current regulations addressing noise pollution are
            described in the Public Order Code. Article 2,201 within the Public
            Order Code outlines the legal framework associated with noise
            pollution, emphasizing the importance of refraining from emitting or
            distributing noise that exceeds specified decibel level limits,
            contingent on the time of day. According to the law, the permissible
            sound levels are set at 65 decibels between 7 am and 10 pm and
            lowered to 55 decibels during nighttime hours. A public order agent
            is assigned to investigate noise complaints by determining the sound
            level using a meter; however, in the absence of such equipment, the
            law allows for a degree of interpretation (C√≥digos de Orden P√∫blico,
            2023).

          <h2 id="noise-mapping">Noise Mapping</h2>
          <p>
            Noise mapping is a valuable tool to assess and visualize noise
            levels across a given region, pinpointing areas of concern, and
            helping decision-makers understand the sources and levels of noise a
            population is exposed to. This information can be used to guide
            governments in forming noise reduction plans that are most effective
            for the area being mapped (Liu et al., 2020; Marques & Pitarma,
            2019; Murphy & King, 2014).
